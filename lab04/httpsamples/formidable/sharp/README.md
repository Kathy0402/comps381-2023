# Node.js Example: Server Parsing Forms (File Upload) submitted via POST requests
This example demonstrates how to handle file upload via POST requests using NPM module [`formidable`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable).  This example server *rotates* and *resizes* uploaded image files using NPM module [`sharp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp).

## Getting Started
### Installing

npm install sharp
npm install
```
### Running

npm start
```

Send a GET request to http://localhost:8099
